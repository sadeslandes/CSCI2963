Because of how through and exhaustive this write-up was I don't feel like there is anything that I can add. One of the things that resonated with me and I have always kept in mind when posing questions, is to go into it with no expectations and not feel entitled to an answer. If people are kind enough to help, marvelous, but regardless of whether you get an answer or not it should be your responsibilty to actively work toward a solution.

Reflection
I am currently continuing work on an RCOS project started last semester called [SplitScreen](https://github.com/tassiahmed/SplitScreen), whose purpose is to add custom screen partitioning and window snapping functionality for easy and intuitive workspace organization to both Windows and OSX. Me participating in this project was actually my largest motivtor for taking this course this semester. Because of my heavy workload last semester I was not able to contribute as much as I would have liked to, but hopefully I can do more this semester.
