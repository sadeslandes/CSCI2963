**Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?**    
	Choosing a license makes it clear to the user the guidelines by which the software may
	be used and distributed, and gives the copyright owner control over how their software 
	can be used. In the case of using an OSI approved open source license, the user immediately 
	knows that the software is open source, and that they have all of the freedoms afforded by 
	"free software".
	
**Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?**    
	Software with no explicit license is considered "All rights reserved", meaning the software
	cannot legally be used by anyone other than the copyright owner.
	
**Gopher's failure and the open systems model**    
	I agree with the [article's](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain) claim. Given
	the time there was probably a scarcity of web developers, and not opening themselves to outside
	developer contribution they essentially shot themselves in the foot. Having the users also be able
	to contribute to the technology also has the added benefit of ensuring that the users are getting
	what they want, which Gopher also missed out on. 
	
**Linux and GLPv2**    
	It makes sense for Linux to use a copyleft license like GPLv2 over a permissive license such as
	Apache because it ensures that any modifications and redistributions also come with the GPLv2 
	license, meaning that it too will be open source. 
	
**Example project**    
	-Project: Open source Physics Engine
	-License: GPLv2
	The reasoning for choosing the GPLv2 license is because I want people to contribute, and I want
	those contributions to also be freely available and free to use for other who wish to contribute.

**Which license for which entity?**    
	A GPL license would be best for the common good because it ensures that all redistributed works also 
	come with the GPL license, thus perpetuating a chain of open source works. For a company, I would argue
	that a permissive license such as the Apache/BSD license would be in their best interest. This kind of license
	makes it possible to use open source software code without having to give any enhancements back to the community
	it came from. From the standpoint of a developer, I would just want people to use and contribute to what I made, 
	therefore I would personally use the MIT License. The LGPL license would also be a viable option as it may also attract
	commercial entities who wish to only use my work (not make a derivative work).
